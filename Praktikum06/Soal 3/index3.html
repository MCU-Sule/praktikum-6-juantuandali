    <p>the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the form of independent traditional and popular</p>

    <p>rhythmic, danceable new form of music that de-emphasized melody and chord</p> 
    <p>progressions to bring a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line and drum part to the</p>
    <p>foreground.</p></div>
